//! Regression test for issue #346.
//!
//! `extract_text` on page 15 (0-indexed: 14) of `1008.3918v2.pdf`
//! panicked with "user-provided comparison function does not correctly
//! implement a total order" from the stdlib's smallsort. Some sort
//! comparator in the reading-order / span-merging pipeline returned a
//! result that is not a total order (typically `partial_cmp` on NaN
//! positions collapsed via `unwrap_or(Equal)`).
//!
//! This test opens the attached PDF and extracts page 15. The
//! pre-fix behaviour is a thread panic from `sort` / `sort_unstable`;
//! with the fix the call completes without panicking.
